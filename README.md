# IMP - Interperter

An interpreter for a rudimentary *imperative* programming language written in Haskell. An imperative language uses a sequence of statements to determine how to reach a certain goal. These statements are said to change the state of the program as each one is executed in turn

## Overview
The language IMP contains two datatypes: *Integers* and *Booleans*. Integers can be combined into arithmetic expressions. Booleans can be combined into boolean expressions. All variables are of the integertype; the boolean type is used in conditionals and other control operators. In addition to these two kinds of expressions, IMP programs consist of a sequence of instructions. These instructions can be executed, which has a practical effect of changing the values of some variables.
